# Structured Program

A **structured program** is a program built using a restricted set of control structures, avoiding arbitrary jumps (GOTO statements) in favor of well-defined composition rules. Dijkstra (1968) advocated structured programming to elevate programming to a scientific discipline, reduce complexity through systematic problem decomposition, enable verification of program correctness before implementation, and improve software reliability and maintainability.

Structured programs follow several core principles. Problems are decomposed hierarchically into well-understood subproblems, with correctness verified at each level. Control structures are limited to those that support clear reasoning about program behavior, including **sequence**, **selection** (IF-THEN-ELSE), and **iteration** (WHILE, DO-WHILE), possibly with controlled **multi-level exits**. Each program component has a single [[Chart Entry Point|entry point]] and a single [[Chart Exit Point|exit point]], ensuring predictable [[Computational History|control flow]].

Several [[Class of Charts|classes]] of structured programs are commonly studied. [[D-Charts|D-charts]] are GOTO-less programs constructed from [[Chart Action|actions]], [[Chart Predicate|predicates]], IF-THEN-ELSE, and DO-WHILE constructs. [[BJ_n-Charts|BJ_n-charts]] extend D-charts with $n$-level loop constructs. [[RE_n-Charts|RE_n-charts]] support structured multi-exit loops (REPEAT-EXIT style), and [[TD_n-Charts|TDn-charts]] model top-down decomposition with $n$ predicates. These classes form a [[Chart Class Reducibility|hierarchy of expressiveness]].

Research in this area focuses on the [[Chart Class Reducibility|relative expressiveness]] of these classes: determining which classes can simulate others, whether more complex structures strictly increase computational power, and identifying structural properties that govern [[Weak Chart Reducibility|reducibility]] between classes. Practically, these results inform language design and help formalize the capabilities of structured programming constructs.
