# Loop

Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be [[Chart Point|points]] in a [[Flow Chart|chart]]. A **loop** passing through points $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (denoted loop-$\alpha\beta$) exists if and only if:

- There is a [[Chart Path|path]] from $\alpha$ to $\beta$, and
- There is a path from $\beta$ to $\alpha$.
