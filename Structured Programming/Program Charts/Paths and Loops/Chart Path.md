# Path

Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be [[Chart Point|points]] in a [[Flow Chart|chart]]. There is a **path** from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ if and only if there exist points $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_m$ where $\alpha = \alpha_1$ and $\beta = \alpha_m$, and there is a [[Chart Direct Path|direct path]] from $\alpha_i$ to $\alpha_{i+1}$ for $i = 1, \ldots, m-1$.
