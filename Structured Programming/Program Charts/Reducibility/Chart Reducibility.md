# Chart Reducibility

Let $G$ and $H$ be two [[Flow Chart|charts]]. **Reducibility** is a relation expressing that the behavior of one chart or class of charts can be represented by another under specified criteria.

Three forms of reducibility are distinguished:

- [[Weak Chart Reducibility|Weak reducibility]], which compares charts by their observable input–output behavior.
- [[Strong Chart Reducibility|Strong reducibility]], which compares charts by both their input–output behavior and their internal [[Computational History|computational paths]].
- [[Chart Class Reducibility|Chart class reducibility]], which compares [[Class of Charts|classes of charts]] based on the weak reducibility of their elements.

Unless otherwise specified, "reducibility" refers to weak reducibility.
