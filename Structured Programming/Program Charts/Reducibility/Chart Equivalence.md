# Chart Equivalence

Two [[Flow Chart|charts]] $G$ and $H$ are **weakly equivalent** (written $G \equiv_w H$) if $G \leq_w H$ and $H \leq_w G$. Weak equivalence means the charts compute the same function and use the same primitives.

Similarly, $G \equiv_s H$ means the charts are **strongly equivalent**—they execute identically for all inputs.
