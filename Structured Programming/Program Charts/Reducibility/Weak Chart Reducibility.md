# Weak Chart Reducibility

Let $G$ and $H$ be two [[Flow Chart|charts]]. $G$ is **weakly reducible** to $H$ (written $G \leq_w H$) if and only if every [[Chart Primitive|primitive]] of $H$ is a primitive of $G$, and for every [[Chart Interpretation|interpretation]] and every input, the outputs are equal for both charts or both do not terminate.

Weak reducibility preserves observable behavior but not necessarily the [[Computational History|computational path]].
