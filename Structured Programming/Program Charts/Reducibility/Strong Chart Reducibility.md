# Strong Chart Reducibility

Let $G$ and $H$ be two [[Flow Chart|charts]]. $G$ is **strongly reducible** to $H$ (written $G \leq_s H$) if and only if:

1. Every [[Chart Primitive|primitive]] of $H$ is a primitive of $G$, and
2. For every [[Chart Interpretation|interpretation]] and every input, the [[Computational History|computational histories]] are identical for both charts.

Strong reducibility preserves the exact sequence of primitive executions.
